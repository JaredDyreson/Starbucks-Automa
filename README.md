## Initial setup

Most of the configuration happens automatically, but for the first portion, you will need to enable the Google Calendar API to have access to your account.

You just need to follow the instructions [here](https://developers.google.com/calendar/quickstart/python) and only do step one.

Once you have the file, please run place the file in the `/tmp` directory as that is where StarbucksAutoma will look for the file.

When running StarbucksAutoma for the first time, it will ask you to copy the link in the terminal to your browser.
After that, it might say that this application is not verified. 
If you feel unsafe using this, you can stop here and uninstall this utility.
However, if you accept this application to be legitimate, you can go to the "Advanced settings" and then continue the authentication flow.

After that, the process should be ready to go from here hence forth.
